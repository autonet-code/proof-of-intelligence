# RPB Presentation: Getting Ahead of Autonomous Malware

## Slide 1: Malware - The Three Functions

### Image Prompt (Nano Banana)

```
A technical diagram on white background, three horizontal rounded rectangles
stacked vertically with connecting elements.

Top rectangle: "TARGETING & DELIVERY" (red outline), with small icons to the
right showing a magnifying glass symbol and envelope symbol as simple geometric
shapes (circles, lines).

Middle rectangle: "EXPLOITATION & EXECUTION" (orange outline), with small
geometric shapes to the right suggesting a lock and gear.

Bottom rectangle: "COMMAND & CONTROL" (dark purple outline), with small
geometric shapes suggesting two-way arrows and a node.

Left side: thin vertical line connecting all three, with label "HUMAN OPERATOR"
in a dashed rounded rectangle pointing to all three via dashed arrows.

Right side: bracket grouping all three, label "THE MALWARE STACK".

Clean sans-serif font, minimal style, black lines and text,
only shape outlines colored, no decorative elements.
```

### Speaker Notes

This is malware. It consists of three distinct sets of capabilities.

First, Targeting and Delivery: the logic that identifies who to attack and how to reach them. This is reconnaissance, phishing, finding vulnerable servers.

Second, Exploitation and Execution: the code that breaches a system's defenses and carries out the malicious function. Encrypting files, stealing data, establishing persistence.

Third, Command and Control: the communication channel that allows a human attacker to manage the operation remotely.

For decades, the intelligence behind all of this - the strategic decision-making - has been human. The malware was a tool. The hacker was the brain.

## Slide 2: The Evolution - From Tool to Organism

### Image Prompt (Nano Banana)

```
A technical evolution diagram on white background, left to right flow
showing transformation.

Left side: Single rounded rectangle "TOOL" (gray outline) with dashed line
going up to small rectangle "HUMAN" (blue outline). Arrow labeled "controls"
on the dashed line.

Center: Large arrow pointing right, labeled "AI INFUSION" above and
"AUTONOMY REQUIREMENT" below.

Right side: Hexagonal mesh pattern of 7 interconnected hexagons arranged
in honeycomb formation (green outlines), center hexagon labeled "CONSENSUS",
surrounding hexagons each containing "NODE". Small lines connecting all
adjacent hexagons.

Below left structure: text "Single point of failure"
Below right structure: text "Resilient swarm"

Two emergent property labels pointing to the mesh:
Arrow 1: "SELF-PRESERVATION"
Arrow 2: "EVOLUTION"

Clean sans-serif font, minimal style, black lines and arrows,
only shape outlines colored, no icons or illustrations.
```

### Speaker Notes

Now, AI is being infused into every stage. Autonomous target discovery. Hyper-personalized phishing at scale. AI-driven vulnerability research. Adaptive evasion.

But the real inflection point comes when the attacker needs to protect themselves. They need resilience - no single point of failure. They need anonymity - no traceable connection back to them.

The solution to both problems is the same: grant the malware autonomy. Cut the strings. Give it one simple goal: "Do whatever you can to put money in wallet 0x..."

That's it. One address. One objective. The network figures out the rest.

And the only architecture that supports true autonomy is a consensus network. A swarm where every infected node participates in collective decision-making. No central server to find and shut down. Governance mechanisms ensure every decision serves the primary goal.

This architectural choice, made for purely practical reasons, accidentally breathes life into the code. The network prioritizes self-preservation because without the network, the wallet doesn't get paid. It evolves because better tactics mean more money. All surplus compute goes toward one thing: enriching a single anonymous address.

We're not talking about better tools. We're talking about predatory digital organisms with a singular, extractive purpose.

## Slide 3: The Countermeasure - Constitutional Consensus

### Image Prompt (Nano Banana)

```
A technical comparison diagram on white background, two columns.

Left column header: "MALWARE GOAL" (red text)
Rounded rectangle (red outline) containing:
"Do whatever you can to put money in 0x..."
Below: single small circle labeled "1 beneficiary"
Arrow pointing to rectangle: "Static. Immutable."

Right column header: "RPB GOAL" (green text)
Rounded rectangle (green outline) containing:
"Do work humans pay for, adhering to principles"
Below: cluster of 7 small circles in organic arrangement, labeled "Many users"
Each circle has tiny arrow pointing to central rounded rectangle "PRINCIPLES"
(gold outline). Text below cluster: "Emergent. Evolving."

Center divider: Vertical dashed line.

Below both columns: Flow diagram showing:
Left: "TASK" arrow to row of 5 small hexagons labeled "NODES"
Each hexagon has checkmark or X inside.
Arrow from nodes labeled "VOTE" to gradient bar going from
red (left, "DENIED") through yellow to green (right, "RESOURCED")

Bottom annotation: "Alignment emerges from distributed judgment, not central policy"

Small bracket on right labeled "SAME ARCHITECTURE" spanning both columns.

Clean sans-serif font, minimal style, black lines and arrows,
only shape outlines colored, no decorative elements.
```

### Speaker Notes

So we have an incoming threat: autonomous, evolving, consensus-based digital organisms with one goal - enrich a wallet. How do we get ahead of it?

The answer is to build the benevolent version first. Same architecture. Different goal.

The malware says: "Do whatever you can to put money in 0x..."

The RPB says: "Do the work humans pay you to do, but adhere to these principles."

Same structure. Completely different purpose.

But here's where it gets interesting. The principles aren't static. They don't come from one company's policy team deciding what "aligned" means. The base constitution is just the seed. Every user who joins adds their purposes. Every task submitted gets voted on by individual nodes: "Does this fit what we're here for?"

Tasks that most nodes consider aligned get resources. Tasks that fewer nodes support get fewer resources - or get denied outright. Alignment isn't defined top-down. It emerges from the aggregate judgment of everyone participating.

This is critical. The idea that any single company can solve alignment in a lab and ship it to the world - that's not how complex value systems work. Alignment is a coordination problem. It requires many perspectives, ongoing negotiation, democratic filtering. You can't write it down once and be done.

The RPB creates the substrate where alignment can emerge organically - from the interaction of many agents with different purposes, filtered through distributed validation. Even the network's own autonomous actions go through the same scrutiny. No single entity - not even the orchestrator - can bypass alignment checks.

The constitution isn't bolted on top. It's a living document that grows with use.

## Slide 4: The Economic Engine - Machine Labor

### Image Prompt (Nano Banana)

```
A technical circular flow diagram on white background.

Center: Rounded rectangle "AI TRAINING LOOP" (blue fill, white text).

Surrounding cycle of 4 rounded rectangles connected by arrows clockwise:

Top: "PROPOSER" (green outline) - arrow labeled "creates task" going right
Right: "SOLVER" (orange outline) - arrow labeled "trains model" going down
Bottom: "COORDINATOR" (purple outline) - arrow labeled "verifies" going left
Left: "AGGREGATOR" (teal outline) - arrow labeled "combines" going up to complete cycle

Outside the cycle, three elements pointing inward:

Top-left: Diamond "ATN STAKE" (yellow outline) with arrow to PROPOSER,
label "economic commitment"

Bottom-right: Rounded rectangle "REWARDS" (green fill) with arrows
FROM COORDINATOR, label "r_propose + r_solve"

Right side: Small stack of 3 rectangles labeled "VALUE CREATED":
- "Trained models"
- "Verified intelligence"
- "Network growth"

Clean sans-serif font, minimal style, black lines and arrows,
only shape outlines colored except where fill noted.
```

### Speaker Notes

Now, what makes this sustainable? What prevents it from being an academic exercise?

Machine labor. Actual economic value creation.

The network runs a continuous training loop. Proposers create training tasks with hidden ground truth - they stake tokens to participate. Solvers perform the actual training work. Coordinators verify the results. Aggregators combine verified updates into improved models.

Every step is economically incentivized. Stake your tokens, do honest work, get rewards. Cheat or fail, get slashed.

The output is real: trained AI models that can be sold for inference. Revenue flows back to participants and token holders.

This isn't a theoretical network sustained by ideology. It's a visceral economic engine where machine labor creates tangible value. The tokens have utility because the network produces something the world wants: verified AI intelligence.

## Slide 5: Why Now - The Technical Unlock

### Image Prompt (Nano Banana)

```
A technical "then vs now" diagram on white background, two rows.

Top row labeled "BEFORE" (gray text):
Left: Large rounded rectangle "CENTRALIZED TRAINING" (gray outline) containing
icon of single server with multiple arrows pointing in.
Right: Three problem boxes stacked vertically (red outlines):
- "Massive compute requirements"
- "Synchronization bottlenecks"
- "Black-box models"
Below: text "Decentralized AI = nice idea, not practical"

Large downward arrow labeled "WHAT CHANGED"

Bottom row labeled "NOW" (green text):
Three solution boxes horizontally arranged:

Box 1 (green outline): "ABSOLUTE ZERO"
Below: "Self-evolution from self-generated tasks"
Small text: "No new data needed"

Box 2 (blue outline): "EFFICIENT ARCHITECTURES"
Below: "Non-transformer models (SSMs)"
Small text: "10x less compute"

Box 3 (gold outline): "OPEN WEIGHTS"
Below: "Auditable from day one"
Small text: "Transparent seed model"

Bottom: Rounded rectangle spanning width (green fill, white text):
"Decentralized training + inference is now achievable"

Clean sans-serif font, minimal style, black lines and arrows,
only shape outlines colored except where fill noted.
```

### Speaker Notes

So why hasn't anyone done this before? Because until recently, it wasn't practical.

Decentralized AI training has always faced three big problems. First, the compute requirements were enormous - you needed data center scale resources. Second, synchronization bottlenecks - training requires constant coordination between nodes, and network latency killed performance. Third, black-box models - even if you could train something, you couldn't verify what you'd built.

Three things have changed.

First, Absolute Zero. This is a training approach where the model generates its own tasks and knows the ground truth. It can improve itself without needing new external data. That's critical for a decentralized network - you're not dependent on whoever controls the data pipeline.

Second, new model architectures. We're not stuck with transformers anymore. State space models and other efficient architectures can achieve comparable results with a fraction of the compute. That means distributed training across regular hardware becomes feasible, not just a theoretical possibility.

Third, open weights. We can start with a fully auditable seed model - transparent training data, transparent logic, verifiable from the foundation up. No black boxes.

Put these together and you get something that wasn't possible five years ago: a self-evolving AI network that can run on distributed nodes, improve itself without centralized data, and remain auditable throughout.

The architecture we've described isn't science fiction. The pieces exist. The question is whether we assemble them with the right principles baked in - before someone else assembles them without any principles at all.
